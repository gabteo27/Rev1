"Hello, I need to create a digital signage application with the following features and functionalities. The main goal is to have a system that can display varied content on screens, with the ability to be remotely managed by an authenticated user through a visually appealing and user-friendly admin panel.

Application Name: (You can suggest a name or leave it for the AI to propose)

Deployment Platforms:

Primary: Amazon Fire TV Stick (Must be installable as an APK).
Secondary (Optional): Raspberry Pi, other Smart TV operating systems (consider the feasibility of installing external applications).
Main Features (inspired by existing solutions and specific needs):

User Authentication (Auth): üîë

Registration and Login System: Users must be able to create an account and access the admin panel with secure credentials (e.g., email and password).
Admin Panel Protection: Only authenticated users will be able to access content upload, editing, and management features.
(Optional but Recommended) User Roles: Consider the possibility of different roles (e.g., administrator, editor) if multiple people are expected to collaborate with different permission levels.
(Suggestion for Replit) Consider Replit Auth: If feasible and it simplifies development, explore using replit.web.auth or Replit's built-in authentication system to handle users within the Replit environment. Otherwise, implement a token-based system (e.g., JWT).
Diverse Content Playback:

Web Pages and Links (Links & iFrames): Ability to display entire web pages or specific sections using iFrames. The user must be able to input any URL.
Images: Support for common formats (JPG, PNG, GIF).
Videos: Support for common formats (MP4). Consider local playback or from links (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, if possible and permitted).
PDF Files: Display PDF documents.
Custom Text: Ability to create slides with formatted text (color, size, font).
Content and Playlist Management:

Content Sequencer: The core of the application. Allow the user to create sequences (playlists) defining the order and duration of each item to be displayed.
Configurable Duration: The user must be able to set how many seconds (or minutes) each item in the sequence is displayed before moving to the next.
Transitions: (Optional, but desirable) Smooth transition effects between different content items.
Overlay Alerts and Notifications: üö®

Urgent Alert System: Functionality to display important messages or alerts that overlay the content currently playing.
Remote Activation: Alerts should be remotely activatable from the admin panel by an authenticated user.
Alert Customization: Allow customization of alert text, background color, and text color.
Integrated Applications (Widgets):

Clock and Date: Display the current time and date. Œè
Weather: Weather widget configurable by location. üå¶Ô∏è
News (RSS Feeds): Display news headlines via user-configurable RSS feeds. üì∞
Social Media: (Optional, consider complexity and APIs) Basic display of social media feeds (e.g., Twitter).
Google Slides/Docs: (Optional, if integration is feasible) Display Google Slides presentations or documents.
Admin Panel and Preview (Web User Interface):

Secure Access: Require authentication for all panel functions.
Visually Appealing Design: The admin panel should have a modern, clean, and professional look and feel, achieved through well-structured HTML and high-quality CSS. It should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
Content Upload and Storage: The authenticated user must be able to upload their images, videos, PDFs, and save links. These files should be stored in their account for future use.
Visual Sequence Editor: An intuitive interface where the user can:
Drag and drop items to order the sequence.
Configure the duration of each item.
Add/remove content from the sequence.
Live Preview: A section in the admin panel showing a real-time simulation of how the content will look on the final screen.
Screen Management (Players): (If planning to control multiple screens) Ability to name and group screens, and assign different content sequences to them.
Interesting Additional Features:

Scheduling: Allow scheduling different content sequences for different times of the day or days of the week. üóìÔ∏è
Screen Orientation: Support for horizontal and vertical orientation.
Remote Content Update: The application on the device (Fire TV, etc.) should be able to automatically check for and download content updates (associated with the user's account/settings) made in the admin panel.
Offline Mode: (Desirable) If the internet connection is lost, the application should be able to continue playing previously downloaded content.
Content Tags/Categories: To better organize uploaded files and links.
Suggested Technologies (or ask the AI to suggest):

Admin Panel Frontend: React, Vue.js, or Angular (running on Replit). Emphasis on using modern CSS frameworks (like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) or custom styling to achieve a high-quality UI.
Admin Panel Backend: Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask (running on Replit). Implement authentication logic (session management, JWT tokens if not using Replit Auth).
Database: Replit DB (Replit's built-in key-value database). Store user profiles, hashed credentials (if implementing custom auth), configuration data, content metadata, and playlists. For larger files (images, videos), consider whether to store links to external services or if Replit's storage is sufficient for the files directly, storing references in Replit DB.
Application for Fire TV Stick: Native Android development (Java/Kotlin) or a hybrid framework like React Native or Flutter. For Raspberry Pi, it could be a web application in kiosk mode or a Python application with a GUI.
Important Considerations:

User Experience (UX) and Interface (UI): The admin panel must be well-designed, intuitive, and responsive. A good user experience is key for usability.
Authentication Security: If implementing a custom system, ensure password hashing and protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF).
Ease of Use: Both the client application and the admin panel should be intuitive.
Performance: Especially on devices like the Fire TV Stick, the application must be fluid.
Replit DB Limitations: Be aware of its key-value nature. For complex relationships or very advanced queries, it might have limitations compared to traditional SQL or more robust NoSQL databases. For storing large media files, it's usually recommended to use dedicated services and only save URLs/references in Replit DB.
Expected Deliverable:

A development plan and application structure, including the authentication flow and considerations for a high-quality UI/UX for the admin panel.
Key code snippets or an initial project base, using Replit DB for data storage, demonstrating the authentication system, and showcasing a well-structured HTML/CSS foundation for the admin panel.
Suggestions on architecture and best practices to follow within the Replit ecosystem, including advice on achieving a good visual design.
Please help me design the structure and main functionalities of this digital signage application, optimized for development and deployment on Replit, including a user authentication system, the use of Replit DB, and a strong emphasis on a well-designed (HTML/CSS) and user-friendly admin interface."
